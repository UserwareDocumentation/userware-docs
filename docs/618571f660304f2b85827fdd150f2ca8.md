## Installation and Version Check  
Before starting an OpenSilver project, verify the installation of the .NET SDK and OpenSilver templates. The following commands work uniformly across Windows CMD or PowerShell, and macOS/Linux Terminal to check the installation status.

```
dotnet --version
```
This command displays the installed .NET SDK version, with 6.0 or higher recommended. If the version is below 6.0, refer to the [Setting Up OpenSilver Tools](https://opensilver.net/tools) guide to update it.

```
dotnet new install OpenSilver.Templates
```
This command installs the OpenSilver templates. After completion, verify the installation with the next command.

```
dotnet new --list
```
The list of available templates should include "OpenSilver" related templates. If they are missing, refer to the [Setting Up OpenSilver Tools](https://opensilver.net/tools) guide to resolve the issue.
# Visual Studio Code  
Visual Studio Code can be used to create and build OpenSilver projects. It supports OpenSilver development across all platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.

## Supported Operating Systems  
- Windows 10 / 11  
- macOS  
- Ubuntu  
- Raspberry Pi  

Visual Studio Code operates smoothly on all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi, providing a consistent environment for OpenSilver development.

## Project Creation  
Open a terminal, navigate to the desired project folder, and execute the following command to create the project.

```
dotnet new opensilverapp -n OpenSilverApp1
```
This generates an OpenSilver web project named "OpenSilverApp1." Open the created project file in VS Code to begin work.

## Open Project in Visual Studio Code  
Launch Visual Studio Code to open the created project.

Select the root folder of the previously created OpenSilverApp1 project using the "Open Folder" option.

## Project Structure  
The OpenSilverApp1 project structure is as follows:  
- [x] OpenSilverApp1  
- [x] OpenSilverApp1.Browser  
- [x] OpenSilverApp1.Simulator  

If developing OpenSilver on macOS or Linux, the Simulator project can be removed, though it may be retained for collaboration with team members working in a Windows environment, depending on policy.

## VS Code Design Mode  
OpenSilver supports an AI-based XAML designer mode in Visual Studio Code, in addition to Visual Studio.

This allows real-time visualization and intuitive editing of XAML designs. The [XAML.io](https://xaml.io) website offers a live experience of this designer editing feature without requiring additional installation.

## Build  
This section outlines two methods to compile a project in Visual Studio Code.

## Terminal Method  
Compile the project by executing the following command in the terminal.

```
dotnet build
```
A successful message upon completion indicates the build is finished.

## VS Code Method  
Use Visual Studio Code's built-in build functionality to compile the project.

Start the build by selecting the "Build" command from the command palette or pressing Ctrl+Shift+B. Choose the "dotnet build" option for the "OpenSilverApp1.Browser" project, and check the results in the terminal window.

## Run  
With the C# Dev Kit extension installed in Visual Studio Code, press F5 to start debugging. A prompt will appear to select the startup project.
