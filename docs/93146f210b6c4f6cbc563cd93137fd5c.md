# Setting Up OpenSilver Tools  
This document outlines the process for setting up OpenSilver development tools. OpenSilver leverages XAML and C# with WebAssembly to extend the capabilities of WPF, WinUI3, MAUI, and all other XAML-based platforms to the web environment.

This section guides XAML developers through the addition of specialized tools required for OpenSilver development, based on previously checked system requirements. It provides clear instructions for essential prerequisites and operating system-specific setup steps.

# Essential Prerequisites  
Before starting OpenSilver development, the following basic prerequisites must be met for each operating system. These steps implement the requirements checked in the previous document ("Checking System Requirements and Compatibility").

## Visual Studio 2022  
Available for Windows, and installing the “.NET Desktop Development” workload is recommended if you plan to leverage Windows XAML platforms like WPF and WinUI3, enhancing integration and development efficiency.

## Visual Studio Code  
Available across all operating systems including Windows, and requires the C# extension to be installed. It is suitable for those preferring a lightweight environment or developing on macOS, Linux, or Raspberry Pi.

## .NET 6.0 SDK  
Required for all operating systems, it supports OpenSilver’s WebAssembly-based execution. Download the appropriate SDK from the Microsoft official website ([.NET Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)) and verify installation with `dotnet --version`.

## WebAssembly Workload  
Activate WebAssembly support by running `dotnet workload install wasm-tools` in the terminal or command prompt. Verify installation with `dotnet workload list`, as this is essential for fully utilizing OpenSilver’s web-based features.

Assuming these prerequisites are met, the following sections detail the operating system-specific setup process for OpenSilver tools.

# Windows 10 and Above  
On Windows, use either Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code to prepare the OpenSilver tools.

## Detailed Steps  
- **OpenSilver Setup for Visual Studio 2022**: Download the latest `.vsix` file (version 3.1.0.5 recommended) from the OpenSilver official website ([OpenSilver Download](https://opensilver.net/download)) and install it. This extension provides project templates and a UI designer.  
- **OpenSilver Setup for Visual Studio Code**: Download the VS Code `.vsix` file (version 3.1.3, beta) from the OpenSilver website and install it. This extension supports XAML UI designer and templates.  
- **Optional**: Installing the IIS URL Rewrite Module improves URL handling during local testing (downloadable from the Microsoft IIS official page).  

This process supports OpenSilver development on Windows.

# macOS 10.15 and Above  
On macOS, prepare the OpenSilver tools using Visual Studio Code.

## Detailed Steps  
- **OpenSilver Setup for Visual Studio Code**: Download the VS Code `.vsix` file (version 3.1.3, beta) from the OpenSilver official website ([OpenSilver Download](https://opensilver.net/download)) and install it. This extension supports XAML UI designer and templates.  

This setup enables WebAssembly-based OpenSilver development on macOS.

# Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or Higher Recommended)  
On Linux, use Visual Studio Code to prepare the OpenSilver tools.

## Detailed Steps  
- **OpenSilver Setup for Visual Studio Code**: Download the VS Code `.vsix` file (version 3.1.3, beta) from the OpenSilver official website ([OpenSilver Download](https://opensilver.net/download)) and install it. This extension supports XAML UI designer and templates.  

This configuration supports OpenSilver development on Linux using the same codebase.

# Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi OS)  
On Raspberry Pi, prepare the minimal OpenSilver tools using Visual Studio Code.

## Detailed Steps  
- **OpenSilver Setup for Visual Studio Code**: Download the VS Code `.vsix` file (version 3.1.3, beta) from the OpenSilver official website ([OpenSilver Download](https://opensilver.net/download)) and install it. This extension supports XAML UI designer and templates (verify ARM compatibility).  

This setup supports minimal OpenSilver development on Raspberry Pi.

# Development Environment Selection and Preparation  
With the OpenSilver tools set up, your development environment for XAML-based web development is ready. Choosing between Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code depends on your development needs. Visual Studio 2022 is advantageous for maximizing migration or integration from existing XAML platforms (e.g., WPF, WinUI3), especially on Windows, where its UI designer and templates enhance productivity. 

Conversely, if you aim for lightweight development across all platforms—Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi—Visual Studio Code is a better fit. Completing the setup steps in this document prepares you for the next phase: project creation and full-scale development.

## Multi-Platform XAML Integration Guide  
OpenSilver, built on XAML and C#, is environmentally similar to all XAML-based platforms, including WPF, WinUI3, and MAUI. Using the set up tools, you can efficiently start OpenSilver development by referencing design patterns, UI elements, and demos from existing XAML projects. For instance, apply WPF’s Grid layout or MAUI’s data binding logic to OpenSilver.

On Windows, leverage Visual Studio 2022’s XAML designer for an optimized experience, while on macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi, use Visual Studio Code to flexibly apply XAML syntax. In the next step, create an OpenSilver project and integrate your existing XAML expertise into web development based on your chosen environment.
