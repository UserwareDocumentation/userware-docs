# Use Cases of OpenSilver  
This document examines OpenSilver’s key use cases, showcasing its versatility and practicality in Silverlight migration and new development.

# Use Cases  
OpenSilver is utilized across various scenarios, offering flexible solutions tailored to development environments and business needs. Below are its primary use cases.

## Silverlight Migration  
Silverlight, introduced in 2007, powered numerous legacy projects but faces security and compatibility issues due to its end-of-support and plugin dependency. OpenSilver migrates these at near-100% compatibility, overcoming Internet Explorer limitations. Implementing OpenSilver eliminates plugins, ensuring pixel-perfect operation across all operating systems, web browsers, and mobile devices.  

Complex UI and logic from Silverlight applications are preserved, running seamlessly on modern browsers. This resolves security vulnerabilities and enhances accessibility, enabling enterprises to modernize legacy systems, ensure sustainability, and reduce costs.

## WPF Migration  
WPF runs and is developed exclusively on Windows, limiting web accessibility and expansion. OpenSilver, with over 90% compatibility with WPF, seamlessly migrates these legacy applications to a web platform. Applying OpenSilver transforms XAML-based superior desktop applications into web solutions.  

WPF legacy applications become executable on the web, delivering consistent experiences across all operating systems, browsers, and mobile devices. Development is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux using Visual Studio or VS Code, allowing developers to transition efficiently with existing skills.

## WPF Desktop Retention and Web Expansion  
OpenSilver supports retaining existing WPF desktop applications while expanding to a web platform. Integrating OpenSilver maintains the desktop application intact, adding web accessibility as an extension.  

Using the same design as WPF, it preserves desktop functionality while OpenSilver extends it to the web. The shared XAML codebase reduces development and maintenance costs, offering a cohesive multi-platform experience.

## Enterprise Applications  
Enterprise settings demand complex solutions. OpenSilver supports MVVM for reliability and scalability. Using OpenSilver ensures consistent performance across platforms.  

It operates reliably in environments requiring large-scale data processing and real-time updates. Supporting enterprise workflows efficiently, its cross-platform compatibility delivers a uniform experience on diverse devices. This enhances the reliability of enterprise solutions.

## Data Visualization and XAML Design  
Data visualization is essential for improving operational efficiency. OpenSilver enables complex, refined designs through XAML’s flexible layouts and CustomControl capabilities. Deploying OpenSilver enhances data presentation.  

VisualStateManager (VSM) manages intricate scenario controls and animations, delivering a refined user experience. WebAssembly’s performance supports real-time processing, enabling immediate visibility into production line status and improving operational efficiency.
