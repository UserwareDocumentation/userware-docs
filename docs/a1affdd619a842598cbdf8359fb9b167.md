# Comparison with Legacy Silverlight  
OpenSilver inherits the legacy of Silverlight while being engineered to meet the demands of modern web development. This document compares Silverlight’s limitations with OpenSilver’s advancements, highlighting proven successes in Silverlight migration and the platform’s expansion into the future of XAML technologies.

## The Past and Limitations of Silverlight  
Silverlight was once celebrated for delivering rich user experiences with XAML and C#, bridging desktop and web development. However, its limitations became evident over time. Silverlight relied on browser plugins for execution, introducing complexities in installation and security vulnerabilities.  

With Microsoft ceasing development after 2012 and ending official support in 2021, no new features or security updates have been provided. This has led to compatibility issues with modern browsers and restrictions on newer operating systems, leaving developers and enterprises to grapple with the maintenance of legacy systems and a lack of future scalability.

## Technical Differentiators of OpenSilver  
OpenSilver reimagines Silverlight’s strengths with modernized technology to overcome its shortcomings. Built on HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly, it runs directly in browsers without plugins, enhancing accessibility without installation and ensuring compliance with current web standards for security and compatibility.  

The use of WebAssembly delivers near-native performance, enabling exceptional responsiveness even in complex business applications. Additionally, based on .NET Standard 2.0, OpenSilver supports modern C# features and libraries, facilitating a cross-platform environment across Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices—capabilities Silverlight could not offer.

## Proven Success in Silverlight Migration  
OpenSilver has accumulated extensive experience migrating Silverlight projects worldwide with near-100% compatibility. Over years of global migration efforts, OpenSilver has successfully reused the majority of Silverlight codebases while preserving UI rendering fidelity and optimizing performance.  

This success spans complex Silverlight applications—such as data visualization tools and interactive dashboards—transitioned to WebAssembly while retaining existing business logic. Establishing itself as a key platform in the Silverlight migration market, OpenSilver delivers a proven solution that minimizes the time and cost of the transition process.

## Expanding into the Future of XAML Technologies  
Leveraging its robust compatibility with Silverlight, OpenSilver is evolving to enhance integration with all XAML-based desktop platforms, including WPF, WinUI, and MAUI. The expertise gained from Silverlight migrations is being applied to extend these XAML technologies into web environments.  

Beyond merely replacing Silverlight, OpenSilver is advancing as a versatile platform that enables the full spectrum of XAML technologies to thrive in modern web development. This empowers existing XAML developers to transition to the web or build new web applications with a consistent technology stack, enhancing the sustainability and scalability of the XAML ecosystem.
