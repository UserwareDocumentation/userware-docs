Dependency injection provides a structure that reduces coupling between modules and facilitates unit testing. It supports reflection-based service discovery and injection, with flexible integration with the service locator pattern.

The project structure is optimized even for large-scale application development. Business logic can be implemented platform-independently through shared projects, and dynamic loading and integration of modules are supported.

Modularization and view injection enable flexible architectural design. Components can be modularized through assembly reflection and singleton pattern-based view injection, and consistent UI/UX can be implemented through template-based design systems. This enables efficient migration while maintaining WPF's trendy development approaches.

## 3. Custom Controls

OpenSilver faithfully implements WPF's CustomControl architecture in the web environment. It supports basic WPF controls and enables extensive customization through ControlTemplate. Complex custom controls developed in WPF can be reused with minimal modifications, and WPF's rich UI features including visual states, triggers, and animations can be utilized as they are.

**Core Features**

* WPF Standard Control Library Implementation
* ControlTemplate and DataTemplate System
* DependencyProperty Support
* Event Routing System

OpenSilver's CustomControl architecture inherits WPF's core control system. The appearance and behavior of controls can be extensively customized through ControlTemplate, and basic controls like ContentControl and ItemsControl operate with structures identical to WPF.

The template system includes WPF's core functionalities. Control appearances can be redefined through ControlTemplate, and data-driven dynamic UI generation is possible through DataTemplate and DataTemplateSelector. This template system operates with patterns identical to WPF, enhancing the reusability of existing template code.

The dependency property system implements WPF's core mechanisms. It includes property value inheritance through DependencyProperty, automatic property change notifications, and animation support. CustomControls based on dependency properties developed in WPF can also be effectively reused, facilitating the migration of complex controls.

The event routing system implements WPF's advanced event handling mechanisms. It supports bubbling and tunneling events, with event handling control possible through e.Handled. This enables systematic event handling even in nested control structures.

OpenSilver's perfect implementation of WPF's CustomControl architecture greatly simplifies the migration of existing WPF applications. Particularly for enterprise applications with many complex custom controls, the ability to transition control logic to the web with minimal modifications is a major advantage.

The data binding system implements all of WPF's powerful binding capabilities. It supports various binding modes including OneWay, TwoWay, and OneWayToSource, and enables advanced binding scenarios such as value conversion through IValueConverter, MultiBinding, and PriorityBinding.

The Command pattern faithfully follows WPF's implementation. Command processing through the ICommand interface and command activation management through CanExecute are supported, and common command pattern implementations like RelayCommand or DelegateCommand can be utilized. Global command processing through RoutedCommand and keyboard shortcut settings through InputBinding are also supported.

Property change notification is implemented around the INotifyPropertyChanged interface. ViewModel property changes are automatically reflected in the UI, and collection change notifications through ObservableCollection are also supported. This enables effective implementation of reactive UIs.

Loose coupling through dependency injection and unit testing facilitation are major advantages of the MVVM pattern. Through integration with the service locator pattern, services needed by ViewModels can be effectively injected, enabling clean separation of business logic from ViewModels. Additionally, communication between ViewModels can be implemented through messaging systems, enabling modularized architecture design.

OpenSilver's comprehensive MVVM support enables migration to web while preserving existing WPF application architecture. Particularly for large-scale enterprise applications, stable migration is possible while maintaining proven MVVM architecture and leveraging web advantages.

## 5. Resource Management

OpenSilver provides complete support for WPF's powerful resource management system. Flexible resource management is possible through StaticResource and DynamicResource, and systematic resource management can be implemented through hierarchical resource dictionary structures.

**Core Features**

* StaticResource/DynamicResource System
* Hierarchical Resource Dictionary Structure
* Theme and Internationalization Support
* Runtime Resource Management

OpenSilver's resource management system directly follows WPF's design philosophy. Optimized resource references at compile time are possible through StaticResource, and resources can be dynamically changed at runtime through DynamicResource. This dual resource reference system provides a balance between performance and flexibility.

Resource dictionaries can be hierarchically organized from application-wide global resources to component-level local resources. This systematic structure enables effective implementation of modern design systems like Material Design or Fluent Design.

Using DynamicResource characteristics, themes or languages can be dynamically changed at runtime. Theme changes like dark mode/light mode switching or language changes can be applied in real-time according to user settings, and new resources from the server can be immediately reflected.

Thanks to this comprehensive resource management system, existing WPF application resource structures can be reused as they are. Particularly for large-scale applications with theme or multi-language support, efficient migration is possible by utilizing existing resource dictionary and dynamic resource reference structures.

## 6. Web Platform Integration

OpenSilver provides natural interaction between XAML applications and the web platform. In particular, web content can be perfectly integrated within XAML through special controls like HTMLPresenter, and all XAML elements are designed to effectively interact with the web platform.

**Core Features**

* HTMLPresenter Control Support
* XAML-Web Element Interaction
* Native Script Integration
* Bidirectional Communication System

OpenSilver is designed to naturally add web-related properties to all XAML controls and layout elements. Through this, existing XAML elements can directly utilize web platform features, and bidirectional communication with JavaScript occurs smoothly.

Native script integration is systematically implemented. JavaScript functions can be directly called from XAML code, and conversely, XAML control features can be utilized from JavaScript. This flexible interaction is particularly useful when integrating complex web functionality into XAML applications.

HTMLPresenter enables perfect rendering and control of web content within XAML applications. Particularly, web view areas implemented using CefSharp or WebView in WPF can be easily migrated and reused with HTMLPresenter, maintaining existing hybrid application web integration structures.

This systematic interaction support is one of OpenSilver's major strengths. Web features needed when migrating WPF applications can be naturally added, and powerful web platform features can be utilized while maintaining existing XAML-based code structures.

## 7. Differences from WPF and Migration Strategies

While OpenSilver implements WPF's core architecture in the web environment, there are some fundamental differences due to web platform characteristics. These differences can be effectively addressed through web standard APIs and server integration, and in some areas, even provide enhanced functionality.

**Key Differences and Solutions**

* File System Access Limitations
* Data Storage and Management
* Application Lifecycle
* Security and Authentication Framework

File system access is a fundamental limitation of the web platform. While direct file system access through System.IO is impossible on the client side, file-related operations can be implemented through the following alternatives:
- File processing through server APIs: File manipulation tasks are handled by sending requests to the server
- File upload/download implementation using web standard File API
- File drag and drop support through HTML5 Drag & Drop API
- Copy/paste functionality through Clipboard API
Particularly, these web standard APIs enable secure file operations within browser security policies.

Data storage and management is restructured for the web environment. To address local database limitations:
- Simple data caching through localStorage/sessionStorage
- Structured data storage using IndexedDB
- Efficient synchronization mechanism with server databases
- Offline data management through PWA caching strategies
These enable stable data management in web applications.

Application lifecycle is managed according to web browser characteristics:
- Application state management based on browser tabs/windows
- Navigation implementation using History API
- Browser refresh, back/forward button support
- Strategies for ensuring application state persistence
Particularly, SPA structure enables user experience similar to native apps.

Security and authentication follow web standards, which can be advantageous:
- Utilization of modern authentication standards like OAuth, JWT
- Secure resource access control through CORS policies
- Enhanced security through browser-based security policies
- Ease of centralized authentication management

These differences present both web platform constraints and new opportunities. OpenSilver effectively addresses these constraints through web standards and server integration, and particularly through modern web APIs, provides scalability and accessibility different from desktop applications.

## 8. Migration Strategy and Process

OpenSilver perfectly implements WPF's core design architecture, allowing WPF projects to be converted to OpenSilver projects almost as-is. Core WPF elements like XAML using syntax, Generic.xaml system, and resource dictionary system are identically implemented, requiring minimal structural changes to existing code. All core WPF controls and layout systems including Window, UserControl, and ContentControl are provided identically, allowing XAML markup to be reused as-is.

**Core Migration Elements**

* Project Structure Conversion
* Trigger Alternative Strategy
* Platform Dependency Resolution
* Gradual Transition Approach

Project structure conversion can utilize WPF's basic structure as-is. Window-based navigation, UserControl componentization, and resource dictionary structure are applied identically, and XAML markup and code-behind patterns can be used without modification. Particularly, WPF's core syntax system including style and template definitions through Generic.xaml and namespace management through XAML using is maintained.

While the Trigger system is a core WPF feature, it isn't provided in modern XAML-based platforms like Uno Platform and AvaloniaUI. OpenSilver provides various alternatives for this. Trigger functionality can be effectively implemented through various alternatives including state management through VisualStateManager(VSM), value conversion through IValueConverter, dynamic template selection through DataTemplateSelector, and interaction handling through ICommand pattern.

Platform dependency resolution can be approached systematically. Platform-specific codes like Windows API calls, file system access, and native resource usage can be converted to web standard APIs or OpenSilver's alternative implementations. Particularly, from layout elements like Grid, StackPanel, DockPanel to complex controls like ItemsControl and DataGrid, all WPF controls are implemented identically, requiring minimal UI code modification.
