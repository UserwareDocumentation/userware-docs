## Installation and Version Check  
Before starting an OpenSilver project, verify the installation of the .NET SDK and OpenSilver templates. The following commands work uniformly across Windows CMD or PowerShell, and macOS/Linux Terminal to check the installation status.

```
dotnet --version
```
This command displays the installed .NET SDK version, with 6.0 or higher recommended. If the version is below 6.0, refer to the [Setting Up OpenSilver Tools](https://opensilver.net/tools) guide to update it.

```
dotnet new install OpenSilver.Templates
```
This command installs the OpenSilver templates. After completion, verify the installation with the next command.

```
dotnet new --list
```
The list of available templates should include "OpenSilver" related templates. If they are missing, refer to the [Setting Up OpenSilver Tools](https://opensilver.net/tools) guide to resolve the issue.

# Visual Studio 2022  
Visual Studio 2022 can be used to create and build OpenSilver projects. It is advantageous in Windows environments for integrating with existing XAML platforms or utilizing UI designers.

Visual Studio 2019 is also functional, but Visual Studio 2022 is recommended for the latest features and stable compatibility.

## Supported Operating Systems  
- Windows 10  
- Windows 11  
- Windows Arm  

Operating systems below Windows 10 may not support the latest Visual Studio or .NET versions properly. Therefore, Windows 10 or higher, preferably Windows 11, is recommended.

## Project Creation  
Launch Visual Studio 2022 and select "Create a new project." Locate and select the "OpenSilver Application" template, specify the project name, set the UI theme and .NET version, then click "Create" to generate the project.

## Template Not Found Case  
If the "OpenSilver Application" or "OpenSilver Library" templates are not visible, it is likely that the .vsix template plugin is not properly installed. Close Visual Studio and refer to the [Setting Up OpenSilver Tools](https://opensilver.net/tools) guide to install the template plugin.

## Default Theme Selection  
OpenSilver supports the classic WPF/Silverlight-style theme and modern Dark/Light themes. You can select a desired theme during project creation, and it can be changed later in the App.xaml file.

## Project Structure  
The OpenSilverApp1 project structure is as follows:  
- [x] OpenSilverApp1  
- [x] OpenSilverApp1.Browser  
- [x] OpenSilverApp1.Simulator  

## Set Startup Project  
An OpenSilver Application is structured with a project named .Browser, generated as a Blazor WebAssembly project. To execute an OpenSilver project implemented with XAML and C#, this .Browser project must be designated as the startup project.

The project containing XAML and C# code, along with the .Browser project, works together to enable execution in a browser.

## Build  
Compile the project by clicking the "Build" button in the Solution Explorer or using the F6 shortcut (or Ctrl + Shift + B). If no errors occur, the build is successfully completed.

If the initial build fails after project creation, it may be due to network issues preventing NuGet package downloads or an improperly installed SDK. In such cases, wait a sufficient amount of time and retry, or restart Visual Studio to resolve the issue.

## Run  
Executing the .Browser project, designated as the startup project, displays the application in a browser.

Visual Studio supports the following three execution methods:  
- [x] Click the "opensilverapp1.browser" debug button at the top of Visual Studio  
- [x] Press F5 (debug mode)  
- [x] Press Ctrl+F5 (run without debugging)

Before running, ensure the startup project is correctly set to .Browser.

The OpenSilver application appears in the Microsoft Edge browser. If the "Hello, OpenSilver!" text, included in the initially generated MainPage.xaml, is visible, the execution is successful. This confirms the default project setup. Users can build upon this foundation by adding various XAML elements (e.g., buttons, checkboxes, text boxes) to MainPage.xaml to expand the UI. For instance, the image shows a richer UI configuration with a StackPanel containing a button and checkbox, in addition to the default text box. Test the UI by clicking the button or selecting the checkbox to verify normal operation, confirming that the OpenSilver application project runs successfully in Visual Studio.

The OpenSilver application appears in the Chrome browser with a default URL of `http://localhost:55592`. It displays a UI including "Hello, OpenSilver!" text, a button, and a checkbox. Test the UI by clicking the button or selecting the checkbox to ensure normal operation.
