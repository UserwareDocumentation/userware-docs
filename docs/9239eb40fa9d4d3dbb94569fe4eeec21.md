# OpenSilver Overview
OpenSilver is a web development platform based on XAML. Applications developed with XAML and C# are converted to HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and run on WebAssembly.

This allows developers to overcome the limitations of traditional desktop applications, enabling applications to function in Pixel Perfect form across all standards-compliant web browsers including Edge, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Additionally, XAML technology can be used on all operating systems and mobile devices without any installation requirements.

OpenSilver is provided as open source through GitHub, continuously evolving through close communication and contributions from OpenSilver users worldwide. Distributed under the MIT license, it can be freely used in commercial projects, with features steadily expanding through active participation from the global developer community.

## A Modern Approach to Web Development
OpenSilver utilizes WebAssembly technology to deliver near-native performance in browsers. This means that complex business applications implemented on the web can provide better performance and user experience compared to JavaScript-based frameworks.

Furthermore, the strong type system of XAML and C# enables early detection of errors during development and stable code management in large-scale projects. This offers significant advantages especially for enterprise-level application development.

# The XAML Developer Experience
 
OpenSilver enables the use of XAML technologies such as WPF, WinUI3, and MAUI in a web-based environment. This allows developers to maintain essential WPF development patterns like MVVM, as well as XAML architectural design experiences such as Prism's dependency injection and view injection.

In addition, developers can use all .NET Standard 2.0-based frameworks and libraries, including CommunityToolkit.Mvvm. OpenSilver itself is provided based on .NET Standard 2.0, maximizing compatibility with XAML-based platform technologies.

With OpenSilver, developers can intuitively design UIs using XAML Designer in Visual Studio. Instead of directly dealing with complex web standards like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, they can create complex UIs concisely using WPF's powerful layout system (Grid, StackPanel, UniformGrid, Border, ItemsControl, etc.). This reduces the complexity of web development while securing the powerful UI composition capabilities of desktop applications.

Particularly noteworthy aspects include:

- **MVVM Pattern and Powerful Data Binding**: OpenSilver fully supports MVVM architecture. Developers can declaratively connect data and UI through markup extensions such as `{Binding}`, `{StaticResource}`, and `{DynamicResource}`, while enabling automatic synchronization of UI and data through two-way binding using `ObservableCollection` and `INotifyPropertyChanged`. The runtime resource replacement through `DynamicResource` provides powerful advantages for dynamic UI updates like theme changes.

- **CustomControl and Modular Development**: Developers can encapsulate reusable UI components through `UserControl` and `CustomControl`, and separate them into different assemblies for modular development. This facilitates smooth collaboration between teams in large-scale applications and enables independent testing and deployment of components. Using `TemplateBinding` and `ControlTemplate`, the appearance and behavior of controls can be completely separated, making it ideal for building design systems.

- **Rich Styling**: Declarative styling using `Style`, `Trigger`, `DataTrigger`, and `VisualState` allows maintaining visual consistency throughout the application while implementing dynamic UI changes. Particularly, theme management through `ResourceDictionary` and `MergedDictionaries` is a great help in maintaining consistent appearance across the application.

- **Enterprise-grade Application Development**: OpenSilver makes it easy to develop complex enterprise applications that are difficult to implement with traditional web platforms. XAML's powerful data binding and layout system, combined with C#'s strong type system and asynchronous programming model, are ideal for large-scale business application development. Enterprise patterns such as dependency injection, unit testing, and layered architecture can be easily applied, enabling the construction of scalable and maintainable applications.

# WPF, Silverlight, and XAML-based Application Migration Experience

Since its official version release in 2020, OpenSilver has established itself as a key platform for migrating WPF, Silverlight, and XAML-based applications globally. Numerous WPF and Silverlight applications have been successfully converted to WebAssembly-based platforms through OpenSilver, and in the process, OpenSilver has accumulated extensive technical know-how and optimization patterns for web migration of XAML applications.

For years, by actively embracing feedback from the global developer community and businesses, OpenSilver has developed expertise to solve various challenges in the XAML codebase conversion process. The platform has continuously strengthened its stability and maturity by addressing complex issues that arise during actual migration processes, such as rendering fidelity of UI components, performance optimization, and third-party library integration.

## Proven Migration Capabilities

One of OpenSilver's greatest strengths is its proven track record of successfully performing large-scale enterprise XAML application migrations across various industries including finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. Through these experiences, OpenSilver has acquired deep understanding and solutions for various scenarios that may arise during the web transition of business-critical applications, beyond simple technology conversion.

It provides exceptional adaptability even in advanced XAML migration scenarios such as complex data visualization, legacy architecture modernization, and project structure redesign. OpenSilver has established itself as an enterprise-grade solution that can flexibly transition to modern web platforms while fully preserving complex business logic and user experience, not just as a simple migration tool. It has opened the possibility of gradually evolving years of accumulated XAML codebase to meet new technical requirements while reusing it.

## Continuous Evolution and Community Contribution

As an open-source project, OpenSilver continues to evolve through contributions and feedback from developers worldwide. Issues and solutions discovered in actual migration projects are continuously reflected in the platform, establishing a virtuous cycle where new migration projects can benefit from previous experiences.

This accumulation of collective intelligence and practical experience is a key element that has enabled OpenSilver to grow into a robust platform for the future of XAML applications, beyond just a technological alternative. The OpenSilver team continuously improves the platform based on this valuable feedback and experience, striving to provide XAML developers with the best migration path.

# About Userware

Userware is a company founded in France in 2007 that, in addition to OpenSilver announced in 2020, has released various XAML-based technologies such as **XAML to Blazor** which allows the use of XAML controls in Blazor, **CSHTML5** which is a technology to convert XAML to HTML, and **XR#**, a XAML-based 3D/VR technology.
