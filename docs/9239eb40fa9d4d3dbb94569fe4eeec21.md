This document introduces OpenSilver, a platform that brings the strengths of XAML and C# to the web, enabling modern application development.

# OpenSilver Overview  
OpenSilver is a XAML-based web development platform that brings the strengths of desktop development into modern web environments. Applications written in XAML and C# are converted to HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by WebAssembly for execution. This overcomes the limitations of traditional desktop applications, delivering Pixel-Perfect UI across major browsers like Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Mozilla Firefox. It runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices without additional installations, offering flexibility for both developers and users.  

OpenSilver is available as an open-source project on GitHub under the MIT license, making it freely usable in commercial projects. It evolves continuously through close collaboration and contributions from a global developer community.

## A New Approach to Modern Web Development  
OpenSilver harnesses WebAssembly to provide near-native performance in browsers. This ensures superior performance and stability compared to traditional JavaScript frameworks when building complex business applications. The robust type system of XAML and C# enables early error detection during development, maintaining consistent quality in large-scale projects.  

It meets the high reliability and scalability demands of enterprise environments, redefining web development paradigms. Additionally, its plugin-free operation distinguishes it from Silverlight, adhering to modern web standards for long-term compatibility.

# XAML Developer Experience  
OpenSilver enables the use of established XAML technologies like WPF, WinUI3, and MAUI in web environments. This allows developers to leverage familiar tools and patterns for web application development. 

The core MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern from WPF is fully supported, along with architectural frameworks like Prism. Built on .NET Standard 2.0, it ensures smooth integration with frameworks such as CommunityToolkit.Mvvm and ReactiveUI.

## Modern C# Feature Support  
OpenSilver provides an intuitive UI design experience through Visual Studio’s XAML designer. Developers can create complex interfaces using familiar WPF layout systems like Grid and StackPanel without directly handling web technologies like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The MVVM pattern cleanly separates business logic from UI, while data binding simplifies dynamic data handling.  

This lowers the barrier to web development, enabling desktop developers to quickly adapt to the web. OpenSilver also maximizes code reusability to enhance productivity. It reduces the time required to transition existing XAML assets to web applications, facilitating efficient team collaboration.

# WPF and XAML-Based Application Migration Experience  
Since its official release in 2020, OpenSilver has emerged as a leading platform for migrating WPF, Silverlight, and UWP applications to the web. Globally, numerous legacy applications have successfully transitioned to WebAssembly-based web solutions using OpenSilver. Through this process, OpenSilver has accumulated extensive expertise in maintaining UI rendering fidelity, optimizing performance, and ensuring compatibility with existing codebases.  

It offers robust support for migrating complex enterprise applications.

## Proven Migration Capabilities  
OpenSilver boasts a proven track record of successfully migrating large-scale XAML applications across industries like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. It preserves existing business logic and user experiences while leveraging the advantages of modern web platforms.  

It addresses migration challenges—such as third-party library integration and complex data visualization—supporting enterprises in modernizing legacy systems. This ensures protection of prior investments while enabling a shift to future-ready technologies.

## Continuous Improvement and Community Contributions  
As an open-source project, OpenSilver continuously improves through feedback and collaboration from developers worldwide. Insights gained from real-world migration cases are integrated into the platform, benefiting new users with prior experiences.  

Active community participation elevates OpenSilver beyond a mere tool, establishing it as a foundation for the future of XAML development. It focuses on delivering reliable migration paths and ongoing support to developers.
