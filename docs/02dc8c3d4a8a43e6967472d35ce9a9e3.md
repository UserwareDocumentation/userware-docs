# Slider Class
Reference

## Definition
**Namespace:** System.Windows.Controls
**Assembly:** OpenSilver.dll

## Overview  
The `Slider` class is a control that allows users to select a value within a range by moving a `Thumb` control along a track. This control can be configured for either horizontal or vertical orientation and is well-suited for continuous value input such as adjusting volume or zoom level.

## Syntax
```csharp
public class Slider : RangeBase
```

## Inheritance
Slider → RangeBase → Control → FrameworkElement → UIElement → DependencyObject → Object

## Implements
- IFrameworkElement
- IInternalFrameworkElement
- IResourceDictionaryOwner
- IUIElement
- IInternalUIElement
- IControl
- IInternalControl
- IDependencyObject

## Remarks  
The Slider control enables users to select a value within a continuous range. It can be set to either horizontal or vertical orientation and allows selection of values between a specified minimum and maximum.  
The `Value` property can be data-bound to other controls or data sources, and the `IsDirectionReversed` property can be used to reverse the direction in which the value increases.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Slider Creation
```xaml
<Slider Minimum="0" Maximum="100" Value="50" />
```

### Vertical Slider
```xaml
<Slider Orientation="Vertical" Minimum="0" Maximum="100" Value="50" Height="200" />
```

### Reverse Direction Slider
```xaml
<Slider IsDirectionReversed="True" Minimum="0" Maximum="100" Value="50" />
```

### Event Handling
```xaml
<Slider Minimum="0" Maximum="100" Value="{Binding Volume}" 
        ValueChanged="Slider_ValueChanged" />
```

```csharp
private void Slider_ValueChanged(object sender, RoutedPropertyChangedEventArgs<double> e)
{
    // Handle the slider value change here.
    double newValue = e.NewValue;
    // Example: SetVolume(newValue);
}
```

### Data Binding
```xaml
<Slider Minimum="0" Maximum="100" Value="{Binding Path=Volume, Mode=TwoWay}" />
```

## Styling and Template Customization

### Overriding the Default Slider Style
```xaml
<Style TargetType="Slider">
    <Setter Property="Background" Value="#E0E0E0"/>
    <Setter Property="BorderBrush" Value="#CCCCCC"/>
    <Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="1"/>
    <Setter Property="Template">
        <Setter.Value>
            <ControlTemplate TargetType="Slider">
                <!-- Define your custom template here -->
            </ControlTemplate>
        </Setter.Value>
    </Setter>
</Style>
```

### Customizing the Thumb Appearance
```xaml
<Style TargetType="Thumb" x:Key="SliderThumbStyle">
    <Setter Property="Template">
        <Setter.Value>
            <ControlTemplate TargetType="Thumb">
                <Ellipse Fill="#0078D7" Width="16" Height="16" />
            </ControlTemplate>
        </Setter.Value>
    </Setter>
</Style>

<Slider>
    <Slider.Resources>
        <Style TargetType="Thumb" BasedOn="{StaticResource SliderThumbStyle}" />
    </Slider.Resources>
</Slider>
```

### Customizing the Track Appearance
```xaml
<Style TargetType="Slider">
    <Setter Property="Template">
        <Setter.Value>
            <ControlTemplate TargetType="Slider">
                <Grid>
                    <Grid x:Name="HorizontalTemplate" Visibility="Visible">
                        <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
                            <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto"/>
                            <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto"/>
                            <ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
                        </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
                        
                        <RepeatButton x:Name="HorizontalTrackLargeChangeDecreaseRepeatButton"
                                     Grid.Column="0"
                                     Width="0" />
                        
                        <Thumb x:Name="HorizontalThumb" 
                               Grid.Column="1"
                               Width="20" Height="20">
                            <Thumb.Template>
                                <ControlTemplate>
                                    <Ellipse Fill="Blue" Width="20" Height="20" />
                                </ControlTemplate>
                            </Thumb.Template>
                        </Thumb>
                        
                        <RepeatButton x:Name="HorizontalTrackLargeChangeIncreaseRepeatButton"
                                     Grid.Column="2" />
                    </Grid>
                    
                    <Grid x:Name="VerticalTemplate" Visibility="Collapsed">
                        <!-- Vertical template content -->
                    </Grid>
                </Grid>
            </ControlTemplate>
        </Setter.Value>
    </Setter>
</Style>
```

## Performance Considerations

- The slider's `UpdateTrackLayout` method is called each time the value changes, which may impact performance in applications requiring frequent updates.
- Using multiple sliders simultaneously can cause cumulative layout calculations that degrade UI responsiveness.
- If the `Value` property changes frequently, consider applying throttling in the `ValueChanged` event handler to minimize layout updates.

## Accessibility

The Slider control includes built-in accessibility support:

- The `OnCreateAutomationPeer` method returns a `SliderAutomationPeer` for integration with accessibility technologies like screen readers.
- Keyboard navigation is supported, allowing the value to be changed using the arrow keys.
- To enhance keyboard accessibility, the following default key inputs are provided:
  - Left/Down Arrow: Decrease the value by `SmallChange`
  - Right/Up Arrow: Increase the value by `SmallChange`
  - Home: Set the value to the minimum
  - End: Set the value to the maximum

For improved accessibility, consider setting properties such as:
```xaml
<Slider AutomationProperties.Name="Volume Control" 
        AutomationProperties.HelpText="Use left/right arrow keys to adjust the volume" />
```

## Limitations and Notes

- The Slider implementation in OpenSilver is similar to Silverlight/WPF; however, some behaviors may differ due to web platform limitations.
- When changing orientation (using the Orientation property), the layout might not update immediately. In such cases, calling the `UpdateLayout()` method is recommended.
- Drag operations depend on mouse events and may behave slightly differently on touch-based devices.
- When using the `IsDirectionReversed` property, ensure that the visual feedback meets user expectations.
- Since the slider’s layout calculations depend on ActualWidth and ActualHeight, they may not be accurate until the container is fully initialized.

## Related Classes

- [RangeBase](link-to-rangebase) - The base class from which Slider inherits.
- [Thumb](link-to-thumb) - The draggable slider element.
- [RepeatButton](link-to-repeatbutton) - Implements the increase/decrease buttons.
- [ProgressBar](link-to-progressbar) - A similar control that displays a range of values.

## Example: Frequency Control Slider

The following is an example of a custom slider for adjusting frequency:

```xaml
<StackPanel>
    <TextBlock Text="{Binding ElementName=FrequencySlider, Path=Value, StringFormat=Frequency: {0:F1} MHz}" />
    <Slider x:Name="FrequencySlider"
            Minimum="88.0"
            Maximum="108.0"
            Value="98.5"
            SmallChange="0.1"
            LargeChange="1.0"
            Width="300"
            TickFrequency="1.0"
            TickPlacement="BottomRight" />
</StackPanel>
```
