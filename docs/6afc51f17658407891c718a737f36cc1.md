# Checking System Requirements and Compatibility  
This document outlines the system requirements and compatibility verification process for starting development with OpenSilver. OpenSilver leverages WebAssembly with XAML and C# to extend the capabilities of all XAML-based platforms, including WPF, WinUI3, and MAUI, into the web environment.

This section examines the essential environment needed for OpenSilver development, providing a foundation to prepare for subsequent steps such as tool installation, project creation, and deployment. It focuses on the core requirements tailored for XAML developers.

# Hardware Specifications  
OpenSilver operates using WebAssembly, enabling support across most modern hardware. The following sections detail hardware specifications suitable for XAML developers to set up and work effectively with OpenSilver.

## Recommended Specifications  
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor at 2GHz or higher (i5, i7, or equivalent recommended).  
- **RAM**: 8GB or more (suitable for large XAML projects and multitasking).  
- **Disk Space**: 20GB or more (includes Visual Studio, OpenSilver tools, and multiple project files).  

These specifications support the setup of an OpenSilver development environment and ensure stable performance, from simple testing to complex XAML-based web application development. The multi-core CPU enhances build and debugging speeds, while 8GB of RAM offers sufficient capacity for handling multiple projects or additional tools. The disk space allocation accounts for development tools, project files, and additional caches or temporary files.

## Additional Considerations  
- **RAM**: 16GB or more (beneficial for concurrent multi-project work or virtualized environments).  
- **Disk**: SSD (improves build and local testing speeds).  
- **Low-spec Devices**: ARM-based devices like Raspberry Pi support execution, but performance limitations make them suitable only for basic testing.  

These additional factors enhance efficiency during later build and deployment phases. An SSD, in particular, boosts disk I/O performance, accelerating the development process.

# Software Requirements  
OpenSilver supports execution in a streamlined environment, utilizing tools familiar to XAML and C# developers to implement WebAssembly-based web applications. Software requirements vary slightly by operating system, and the following sections describe the essential components for each in detail.

## Windows 10 or Later  
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later (latest updates recommended).  
- **.NET Core**: .NET 6.0 or higher (required for WebAssembly support).  
- **Development Tool**: Visual Studio 2022 (Community, Professional, or Enterprise editions).  

Windows offers an optimized platform for OpenSilver development. Visual Studio 2022, exclusive to Windows, provides an XAML designer and debugging features, integrating closely with XAML-based platforms like WPF and WinUI3. Installation must include the “.NET Desktop Development” workload, and .NET 6.0 can be downloaded from the official Microsoft website. Verify installation with the `dotnet --version` command.

## macOS 10.15 or Later  
- **Operating System**: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later.  
- **.NET Core**: .NET 6.0 or higher (required for WebAssembly support).  
- **Development Tool**: Visual Studio Code.  

On macOS, Visual Studio 2022 is not supported; instead, Visual Studio Code is utilized. VS Code supports OpenSilver development in a lightweight environment, and after installing .NET 6.0, the version can be verified in the terminal with `dotnet --version`. Adding the C# extension (C# for Visual Studio Code) post-installation enables efficient management of XAML and C# code.

## Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or Later Recommended)  
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 or later, or equivalent Linux distribution.  
- **.NET Core**: .NET 6.0 or higher (required for WebAssembly support).  
- **Development Tool**: Visual Studio Code.  

Linux does not support Visual Studio 2022, making Visual Studio Code the primary development tool. Install .NET 6.0 and confirm with `dotnet --version`, then add the C# extension to VS Code. OpenSilver’s WebAssembly execution allows the same codebase to be utilized across Linux environments.

## Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi OS)  
- **Operating System**: Raspberry Pi OS (latest version recommended).  
- **.NET Core**: .NET 6.0 or higher (ARM-supported version).  
- **Development Tool**: Visual Studio Code.  

Raspberry Pi provides minimal support for OpenSilver development on ARM architecture. Install the ARM version of .NET 6.0 and use VS Code for a lightweight setup. Check the .NET installation status with `dotnet --version` and add the C# extension. Resource constraints may limit execution of large-scale projects.

# Supported Browsers and Compatibility  
OpenSilver supports execution in browsers via WebAssembly, delivering high-quality XAML UIs in a web environment. The supported browsers, including default and popular options across operating systems, are listed below:

- **Google Chrome**: Latest version (available on all operating systems).  
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Latest version (available on all operating systems).  
- **Microsoft Edge**: Latest version (default on Windows, installable on macOS/Linux).  
- **Apple Safari**: Latest version (default on macOS, includes iOS).  
- **Chromium**: Latest version (popular on Linux and Raspberry Pi OS).  

Operating without plugins through WebAssembly, OpenSilver ensures a consistent experience across Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS. Using popular options (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) alongside default browsers allows verification of compatibility across diverse environments. At this stage, ensure at least one major browser is updated to its latest version.

## Browser Preparation  
WebAssembly delivers high performance in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Chromium. On Raspberry Pi, Chromium performance may vary with hardware capabilities, while on macOS, installing Chrome alongside Safari can broaden testing scope. For Azure deployment considerations, mobile environment checks are also recommended.

# Preparing for XAML Development  
OpenSilver provides a streamlined environment for XAML and C# developers. Verifying the hardware and operating system-specific software requirements outlined in this document completes the preparation for WebAssembly-based web development. Proceed to the next steps of installing OpenSilver tools and creating projects to implement XAML capabilities on the web.

## Tips for Leveraging XAML-Based Platforms  
OpenSilver, built on XAML and C#, shares environmental similarities with all XAML-based platforms, including WPF, WinUI3, and MAUI. This allows developers to reference existing XAML project design patterns, UI elements, and demos to efficiently initiate OpenSilver development. For instance, WPF’s Grid layouts or MAUI’s data-binding logic can be adapted to OpenSilver.

On Windows, Visual Studio 2022’s XAML designer optimizes this experience, while macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi support XAML syntax through VS Code. Installing OpenSilver tools in the next step enables developers to effectively integrate existing XAML knowledge into web development.
